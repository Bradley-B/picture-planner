  <h1>Hey</h1>

  <img src="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/yllevad-collage-frame-for-4-photos-black__0809065_pe770938_s5.jpg?f=s" alt="ikea frames on a wall"/>

    So, do you know those picture collages with lots of frames that are all a part of one source image?
    Like this one from ikea.

    I wanted to make one of those, but I was having trouble visualizing how the picture should look.
    What parts of the big image should be in frames? I don't know, ya gotta be some kinda design genius.

    Anyway, I decided to make this tool that cuts holes from an image so you can see how the final thing will look.
    To use it, put some picture frames on the image and click/drag them around.

    It'll tell you the size you should make your background image to maintain the current visual scale.
    To change the scale, change the "pixels per inch" option in the sidebar or resize your screen.

    Only supports desktop screens because mobile is too small.
    The jank is part of the charm ðŸ’–
